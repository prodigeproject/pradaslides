# Artifact contracts

These JSON files form a renderer-neutral intermediate representation. They are living project artifacts, not prose documentation.

The production chain is:

`brief → source ledger + asset manifest → capability route → design system + layout manifest → deck plan + visual-generation plan → authoring source → previews → QA → exports`

## `capability-profile.json` and `execution-plan.json`

`capability-profile.json` declares verified model, tool, and runtime capabilities. Each entry uses `available`, `unavailable`, `unknown`, or `delegated`. A delegated capability requires a named provider and permission to use separate tools. Run `scripts/resolve_capabilities.py` to produce `execution-plan.json`, which owns the selected operating mode, artifact route, media fallbacks, QA route, warnings, and blocking external gates.

Keep environment capability separate from user intent. Do not put model availability in `brief.json`, and do not mutate the brief when tools change.

`execution-plan.json` includes a `creative_route`. When generation is usable it requires an opportunity audit and recommends intent-fit visual jobs, a small candidate budget, a distinctness rule, and a visual-review route. Resolve the actual creative choice in `visual-generation-plan.json`.

## `brief.json`

Required top-level fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "project": "Example deck",
  "task_mode": "new",
  "primary_intent": "business-proposal",
  "secondary_intent": null,

    "desired_state": "Aligned on a 90-day pilot",
    "decision_authority": "COO",
    "objections": ["Implementation disruption", "Data quality"]
  },
  "communication_job": "By the end, operations leadership should approve a 90-day pilot because the proposed workflow addresses the two verified bottlenecks with bounded implementation risk.",
  "central_takeaway": "A bounded pilot can reduce the two largest delays without a full-system replacement.",
  "final_action": "Approve pilot scope, owner, and start date",
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "hybrid",
    "duration_minutes": 20,
    "slide_count_target": 12,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "language": "en",
    "output_formats": ["pptx", "pdf"],
    "editability": "native-preferred"
  },
  "brand": {
    "status": "none",
    "assets": [],
    "constraints": []
  },
  "source_policy": {
    "research_allowed": true,
    "citations": "visible-for-key-claims",
    "confidentiality": "internal"
  },
  "invariants": [],
  "assumptions": [],
  "open_questions": []
}
```

Allowed `task_mode`: `new`, `redesign`, `fill-template`, `enhance-existing`, `critique`, `plan-only`.

Allowed `primary_intent`: `portfolio`, `work-results`, `business-proposal`, `sales`, `investor-pitch`, `strategy-decision`, `research-technical`, `teaching-workshop`, `keynote-launch`, `report-async`, `template-system`.

Allowed `delivery.mode`: `speaking`, `hybrid`, `reading`.

## `design-system.json`

`design-system.json` owns the visual direction and quality floor independently of any one renderer. Required groups:

- `direction`: communication mode, visual cluster, 3–5 behavioral character terms, reference principles, and avoid list;
- `canvas`: fixed dimensions, safe margin, columns, gutter, and baseline;
- `typography`: display/body/mono families, fallback policy, type scale, line budgets, and a product-specific `selection` rationale based on archetype, positioning, audience, personality, proof density, and interaction model;
- `color`: semantic colors and light/dark/accent tone palettes;
- `furniture`: default/optional wayfinding elements and motif limit;
- `rhythm`: topology variety, repetition limits, tone shifts, and card-grid limit;
- `quality_floor`: thumbnail, squint, evidence scale, contrast, copy fit, reference floor, and target-runtime checks.

Validate with `scripts/validate_design_system.py`.

## `layout-manifest.json`

`layout-manifest.json` separates relational topology from style. It contains:

- topologies such as `stage`, `split`, `spine`, `axis`, `matrix`, `stack`, `network`, `mosaic`, `field`, and `frame`;
- layouts that declare compatible roles/relationships, required and optional slots, media/item capacity, density, tones, fidelity, and guardrails.

Use a known `layout_id` in the deck plan. A `custom-*` layout is allowed only with `layout_rationale`. Validate the registry with `scripts/validate_layout_manifest.py`.

## `source-ledger.json`

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "S01",

      "status": "verified",
      "slide_ids": ["P04"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Allowed claim `class`: `supplied-fact`, `external-fact`, `calculation`, `judgment`, `assumption`, `scenario`, `quote`.

Allowed status: `verified`, `needs-check`, `scenario`, `excluded`, `confidential`.

## `asset-manifest.json`

`scripts/analyze_assets.py` writes the technical fields. The agent must fill the semantic and placement fields after viewing the assets or video keyframes.

```json

    }
  ]
}
```

Allowed slide `role`: `cover`, `section`, `content`, `pause`, `closing`, `appendix`.

Allowed `journey_phase`: `attention`, `orientation`, `tension`, `insight`, `proof`, `resolution`, `decision`, `retention`.

Every `content` slide requires non-empty `claim`, `evidence_ids`, `visual_role`, `visual_form`, and `transition`. Every slide using the default manifest requires `layout_id`, `topology`, `tone`, `emphasis`, and `slot_budget`. `evidence_ids` may contain a judgment/assumption claim ID, but the source ledger must make its class explicit.

Every slide with `asset_ids` requires a resolved `media_plan`. Under strict visual validation, slides with multiple assets also require `media_plan.asset_treatments`: one object per used asset with `asset_id`, `treatment`, `placement`, `crop_mode`, `focal_anchor`, `text_safe_region`, `fallback`, and `alt_text`. Per-asset treatment prevents a logo, hero, screenshot, and video from accidentally inheriting the same crop or fallback behavior. Logos and assets with `crop_tolerance: none` accept only `contain` or `none` crop modes.

## `visual-generation-plan.json`

This artifact proves that generation capability was activated or consciously declined.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "capability_status": "available",
  "decision": "use",
  "decision_reason": "A custom cover hero will express orchestration without pretending to be operational evidence.",
  "budget": {

    "final_unique_images": 1,
    "video_candidates": 0
  },
  "operations": [
    {

      "slide_ids": ["P01"],
      "purpose": "Create a distinctive cover entry",
      "use_case": "stylized-concept",
      "asset_type": "full-bleed cover hero",
      "narrative_job": "turn fragmented handoffs into one controlled path",
      "composition": "16:9; calm left text-safe field; focal object on right",
      "difference_from_other_visuals": "Conceptual hero; later slides use native evidence and supplied UI",
      "prompt": "Provider-ready prompt",
      "constraints": ["no text", "no logo", "no UI", "brand-safe"],
      "avoid": ["stock office", "flowchart boxes", "sci-fi neon"],
      "expected_output": "assets/generated/P01-orchestration-hero.png",
      "review": {

      },
      "fallback": "typographic hero with native process motif",
      "provenance": {
        "provider": "declared image tool",
        "model": null,
        "created_at": null,
        "prompt_saved": true
      },
      "status": "planned"
    }
  ]
}
```

Allowed `decision`: `pending`, `use`, `skip`, `unavailable`, `delegated`. `pending` is invalid when authoring begins. Every final generated asset must also appear in `asset-manifest.json` with generated provenance and reviewed semantic placement.

## `reference-benchmark.json`

This artifact owns the reference-relative quality verdict for a rendered candidate. It records the target HTML runtime, the selected or floor-only role of every supplied reference, the transferable principle and anti-copy constraint, ten universal craft criteria, render evidence, blockers, and repair history.

Scores are invalid without a rationale and evidence path. `status: final` requires all universal criteria at or above their declared floors, every applicable criterion marked `pass`, a slide montage and console capture, and an empty blocker list. Use `not-applicable` only for reference-specific style relevance; it cannot exempt a universal criterion.

```bash
python scripts/validate_reference_benchmark.py <project-dir>/reference-benchmark.json --require-final
```
